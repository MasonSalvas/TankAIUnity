# TankAIUnity
This was a project that I did in my AI class at Daniel Webster.  This was a group project as well so we were able to refine it into a refine the AI.


# Description

In this project, the goal was to create a stoplight that the tanks would follow.  To demonstrate this, we placed the stop light in a 4 way intersection.  This project was used to demonstrate the use of behavioural trees and how to apply this concept in actual code.
